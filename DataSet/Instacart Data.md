## Please note that this is a free instacart dataset from Kaggle...NOT FROM ITRADENETWORK

# Background
iTradeNetwork has insights from the point produce is harvest to the point it enters the grocery store. However, we don't have any information about the produce once a consumer purchases it. You can use the datasets from the link above to expand on that and build a complementary module for our Trace product.

# About the data
This would be a good dataset to use if you are going to expand on how products are being order and consumed.
